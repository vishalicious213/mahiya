            <h3>My quest with leggings</h3>
            <p>There was a time in my life when I used to train heavy. My lower body was so built I almost can’t believe they were mine (haha). Gone are those days. Recently however after a long five-year hiatus from that, I decided to begin some of those old routines. But because it’s been such a long time, I’m needing to train my mind to focus. So, I began watching hours of YouTube videos of women training while I’m training myself. This has been helpful but at one point I found myself needing training clothes like those on the YouTube videos. Only one problem: they’re extremely expensive, hard to find, and no way to know what you are looking for.</p>
    
            <p>This is a recording of how I would “UX” the perfect leggings. </p>
