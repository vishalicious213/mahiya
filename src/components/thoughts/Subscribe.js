            <h1 id='thought-heading'>App critique- Amazon’s Subscribe and Save</h1>
            <p className='thought-text-2'>I purchase a ton of supplements from amazon regularly every month. I’m pretty familiar with their subscribe and save program. However, as someone who gets these items regularly, I cannot use the program for its intended purpose, which is to save you time and money by automating the process.</p>
            <p className='thought-text-2'>This is an analysis of what subscribe and save currently does and what I think it could do to accomplish my goals.</p>

            <div>
                <div id='center'>
                    <p className='thought-text-2'>&#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</p>
                </div>
                <h3 className='thought-title-2'>Does not relay the information I need causing confusion.</h3>
                <p className='thought-text-2'>Currently, I can go to any item that allows me to subscribe, purchase it one time or setup subscribe & save. However, I have never set up the subscribe & save from the beginning of its flow. It <b>auto-generates a date in the future</b>, which is <b>unchangeable</b>, and only recently I noticed a <b>“get it sooner” link</b> which adds it to the cart.</p>
                <div>
                    <div></div>
                    <div></div>
                    <div></div>
                </div>
                <p>When I click the “change” link, my expectation is that I can change the date. It was only during my analysis for this article, I realized it simply tells you that by ordering now you won’t get a discount.</p>
                <p className='thought-text-2'>I never even saw that they give you the option between getting now and getting no discount or getting later and getting a discount. I always add the item to the cart first and then from inside the cart, I subscribe to get the discount. But I only ever saw the minimum discount sometimes, never really thought much about it.</p>

            <h3 className='thought-title-2'>Exploration</h3>
            <p className='thought-text-2'>The features people desire in leggings is something I would need to dig out. For example, I like v-cuts in the front that are midrise and I sometimes like the scrunch. But I don’t want all my leggings to look the same so I would like the freedom to mix and match features. Someone else may only like high-rise v-cuts. The features that could exist and the features that people desire need to be defined.</p>
            <p className='thought-text-2'>Material is another important element. This could determine how hard you hit the gym on leg days. We’re already straining our minds with having to focus on our muscles; we don’t want to strain our body too by being too hot or too cold, having to constantly fix a wedgie or constantly pulling up these leggings because they’re not squat proof.</p>
            <p className='thought-text-2'>To find out the right type of material and the specific features people desire, we need a few friends with various body types to try on leggings from Alphalete, gymshark, bombshell sports and other fit-attire retailers. They would use these leggings everyday working out, journaling their experience with for example how they fit during activities, how cool or warm they are, and how they might feel and look. This analysis would then tell us what about these leggings are working and what’s not working.</p>

            <h3 className='thought-title-2'>Final thoughts</h3>
            <p className='thought-text-2'>Using this data, we would then design a solution where you could choose the things you want in a pair, rather than randomly selecting anything that looks good on your computer screen. I could pick the scrunches that also come with a v-cut front or pick a pair of v-cuts that are not high rise. Possibilities are endless. In this way we could buy the kinds of leggings that make us feel like a million bucks.</p>
